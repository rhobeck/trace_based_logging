# Logging Ethereum Applications Based on Transaction Traces

This project can be used to log execution data of decentralized applications (DApps) deployed to Ethereum.
The execution data is generated by recomputing transaction traces, i.e., the computational steps to process an Ethereum transaction.
On a high level, the code implements the following functionality for a user-defined blockrange: 

1. Extraction: Recursively re-create transaction traces for contract addresses and discover addresses belonging to a DApp by following CREATE-relations from contract deployments in the transaction trace data.
3. Decode: Decode the blockchain log entry, CALL, and DELEGATECALL input data in the transaction traces based on contract ABIs.
4. Transform: Example code to transform the decoded trace data to an event log for object-centric process mining (OCEL 2.0).

There are prerequisites for running the program: 
- Etherscan API Key. The transaction retrieval is based querying normal transactions and internal transactions from Etherscan.  
- Ethereum Archive Node with a Geth-based client (e.g., Geth or Erigon).
  - Transaction retrieval by events (Ethereum log entries) uses the Python web3 library function ```eth.get_logs``` https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.eth.html#web3.eth.Eth.get_logs 
  - The program recreates transaction traces based on the Geth debug function ```debug_traceTransaction``` https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-debug#debug_traceTransaction


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```console
git clone [this project]
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Configuration

Before running the main script, configure the json files in the project folder. 

`config.json`, a file with basic parameters:

### Ethereum Node Configuration (`ethereum_node`):
- **`port`**: Port to connect to the Ethereum archive node (`8081` by default).
- **`protocol`**: Protocol used for connection (`http://` by default).
- **`host`**: IP address of the Ethereum archive node (`127.0.0.1` by default).

### Contracts (`contracts`):
- **`dapp`**: List containing contract addresses that belong to the DApp.
- **`non_dapp`**: List containing contract addresses explicitly excluded from the DApp.

### Block Range (`block_range`):
- **`min_block`**: Minimum Ethereum block number for data extraction.
- **`max_block`**: Maximum Ethereum block number for data extraction.

### Data Extraction (`extraction`):
- **`normal_transactions`**: `true` to extract normal transactions from Etherscan.
- **`internal_transactions`**: `true` to extract internal transactions from Etherscan.
- **`transactions_by_events`**: `true` to extract blockchain events from the Ethereum node.
- **`etherscan_api_key`**: Your API key for Etherscan, required to fetch contract ABIs.

### Output Settings (`output`):

#### DApp-related (`dapp`):
- **`events`**: Include events emitted by DApp contracts (`true`/`false`).
- **`calls`**: Include calls involving Ether transfers to DApp contracts (`true`/`false`).
- **`delegatecalls`**: Include delegatecalls to DApp contracts (`true`/`false`).
- **`zero_value_calls`**: Include calls without Ether transfers to DApp contracts (`true`/`false`).
- **`creations`**: Include creation transactions of DApp contracts (`true`/`false`).

#### Non-DApp-related (`non_dapp`):
- **`events`**: Include events emitted by contracts outside the DApp (`true`/`false`).
- **`calls`**: Include calls involving Ether transfers to non-DApp contracts (`true`/`false`).
- **`delegatecalls`**: Include delegatecalls to non-DApp contracts (`true`/`false`).
- **`zero_value_calls`**: Include calls without Ether transfers to non-DApp contracts (`true`/`false`).
- **`creations`**: Include creation transactions of non-DApp contracts (`true`/`false`).

### Processing Stages (`stages`):
- **`extraction`**: Enable or disable extraction stage (`true`/`false`).
- **`decoding`**: Enable or disable decoding stage (`true`/`false`).
- **`transformation`**: Enable or disable transformation stage (`true`/`false`).

### Miscellaneous (`misc`):
- **`sensitive_events`**: `true` if logging sensitive event data.
- **`log_folder`**: Folder path to store output logs (`output` by default).


`config_custom_events.json`, a file with ABI specifications for decoding the data. Reason: even if the ABI of a contract is not available (on Etherscan), event or functions specified in `config_custom_events.json` can still be decoded. By default this includes ABI specifications to decode the events from the standards ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-777, and ERC-1155 (and two custom Augur events).


## Usage

To execute the main function of the project, run:
```console
python src/trace_based_logging/__main__.py
```

The resulting files contain tabular transaction trace data. Case-specific data transformation helps to create meaningful activity labels and objects. An example implementation for the DApp Augur is provided in [example_transformation_augur.py](log_construction/transformation_augur.py).
