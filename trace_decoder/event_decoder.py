def event_decoder(address, topics, data, dict_abi, fallback_abis):
    """
    Decodes an event log using a primary ABI and a set of fallback ABIs.

    This function attempts to decode an event log based on the provided ABIs. It starts with the primary ABI associated with the contract address and proceeds to try each of the fallback ABIs in order if decoding with the primary ABI fails.

    Args:
        address (str): The blockchain address from which the event originated. Used for logging purposes.
        topics (list of str): The list of topics associated with the event. The first topic is usually the hash of the event signature.
        data (str): The data payload of the event, containing the values of the event parameters.
        dict_abi (dict): A dictionary of all ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces) that was extracted for the contracts the events are associated with.
        fallback_abis (dict): A dictionary of fallback ABIs with their names as keys. These ABIs are used in order if the primary ABI fails to decode the event. In that case
            The fallback_abi contains:

                # CUSTOM EVENTS, E.G., FOR AUGUR

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary representing the decoded event if successful. The dictionary includes the event name and parameters.

    Raises:
        Exception: An exception is raised if the event cannot be decoded with any of the provided ABIs.
