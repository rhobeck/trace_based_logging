"""
This module provides functionalities to fetch and process blockchain transaction data from Etherscan (normal and internal transactions) and a blockchain node via Web3 (blockchain events). It supports fetching normal transactions, internal transactions, and transactions by events for specified Ethereum contracts within a given block range.

Functions:
- send_api_request: Sends a request to the Etherscan API to fetch transaction data.
- request_mediator: Processes the JSON response from Etherscan, converting it into a DataFrame.
- get_transactions: Fetches and processes transactions for a list of contracts.
- get_transactions_by_events: Fetches transactions by querying contract events and extracting the transaction hashes.
- event_fetcher: Fetches logs of events from a blockchain node using Web3.

Constants:
- CHUNK_SIZE: Defines the chunk size for processing blocks in batches.
- DELAY: Specifies the delay between API requests to manage server load and avoid throttling.
"""

# The function get_transactions_by_events() works in chunks; here is the definition of the chunk size
CHUNK_SIZE = 10000
# At times, recovery times for servers between requests make sense; here is the definition of the recovery time
