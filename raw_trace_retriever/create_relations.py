def create_relations(df_trace_tree, contracts_dapp, set_contracts_lx, set_predefined_non_dapp_contracts):
    """
    Analyzes blockchain transaction traces stored in a dataframe to identify CREATE-relationships between contracts related to a DApp. 
    This process involves identifying contracts created by or that created known DApp contracts, and updating the set of contracts associated with the DApp. 
    Additionally, it filters out predefined non-DApp contracts.

    Args:
        df_trace_tree (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing transaction trace data, which includes information on transactions with types "CREATE" or "CREATE2".
        contracts_dapp (set): A set of contract addresses known to be part of the DApp.
        set_contracts_lx (set): A dynamic set of contract addresses under investigation for their relevance to the DApp. It gets updated throughout the function execution.
        set_predefined_non_dapp_contracts (set): A set of contract addresses known not to be part of the DApp, used for filtering purposes.

    Returns:
        tuple: Returns a tuple containing two sets:
            - contracts_dapp (set): An updated set of contract addresses confirmed to be associated with the DApp after processing.
            - set_contracts_lx (set): A refined set of new contract addresses identified as related to the DApp, excluding those predefined as non-DApp contracts.

    Detailed Process:
        1. Filters the transaction traces to consider only "CREATE" and "CREATE2" transaction types as these indicate contract creation events.
        2. Cleans up the "from" addresses in the traces by removing any appended sequence numbers, retaining only the actual address part.
        3. Identifies relevant contracts based on their creation relationships. A contract is deemed relevant if:
            - It is created by a contract known to be part of the DApp.
            - It is a known DApp contract being created in the trace.
        4. Iteratively updates the set of DApp contracts as new relationships are discovered through the traces.
        5. Filters out any contracts identified as non-DApp contracts from the set of newly discovered contracts to ensure the purity of the DApp's contract ecosystem.
        
    Note:
        The function employs a temporary solution for identifying CREATE-relations by trimming the "from" addresses to their first 42 characters, due to a workaround for encoding the order of computational steps in the trace data. 
        Future improvements could refine how order and relationships are encoded and identified.

    # Big issue in blockchain and therefore in the code is the ordering of events (essentially: http://www.workflowpatterns.com/patterns/logimperfection/elp1.php).
    # In order to insert an order, the position of a computational step in the trace tree was stored as an extension of the "from"-address in the JSON (attached _[count] to "from" address). This can be improved.
    # As a consequence, the "from"-address now has to be liberated from its coding accident related attachement. To fix the issue, only use the first 42 characters of the "from"-addresses (only characters that belong to the actual address), and omit the attached order.
    # This remains temporary for the identification of CREATE-relations

    # 1) Contracts were created by contracts we know belong to the DApp -> Created contracts are relevant (contracts that have "from"-address set_contracts_lx)
    # 2) Contracts we know belong to the DApp were created -> Creating contracts are relevant (contracts that have "to"-address set_contracts_lx)
    # Those contracts identified might then in turn have additional relevant CREATE-relations like 1) and 2), hence, we have move on iteratively and the the whole state of traces has to be considered
